# Hi there, I'm Alexander Lind 👋

I'm a software engineer based in Aarhus, Denmark, with a Master's degree in Engineering. My main focus is on developing full-stack web or desktop applications, using modern frameworks and technologies. I believe that as a developer, you should be building the future you want to live in yourself.

## 💻 Technologies & Tools
- TypeScript / Python / Node.js / React / Next.js / TailwindCSS / Prisma / Express / tRPC / SQL

- .NET/C# / ASP.NET

- Git / GitHub / Visual Studio Code

## :heavy_check_mark: Completed Projects

## :hourglass: Projects in progress

- [ALPACA - Learnovate Center](https://www.learnovatecentre.org/alpaca/) - ALPACA is a gamified, highly-visual tool to detect reading difficulties in young children. I'm currently working pro-bono on improving the data visualization of student assessment data.

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning

### I'm always learning and expanding my knowledge. Right now, I'm focusing on:

- Serverless computing
- Cloud architectures such as AWS and Azure.
- Docker

## 🔍 What I'm Looking For
